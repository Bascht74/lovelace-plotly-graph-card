```

## Features

- Anything you can do with scatter and barcharts in plotly
- Zoom / Pan, etc.
- Data is loaded in the background
- Axes are automatically configured based on the units of each trace
- Configuration compatible with the History Card

For now only the only allowed chart types are:

- Bar charts https://plotly.com/javascript/bar-charts/#basic-bar-chart
- Line and scatter https://plotly.com/javascript/line-and-scatter/

## entities:

- `entities` translates to the `data` argument in PlotlyJS

  - each `entity` will be translated to a trace inside the data array.
    - `x` (states) and `y` (timestamps of stored states)
    - you can add any attribute that works in a trace

- see https://plotly.com/javascript/reference/scatter/#scatter-line for more

## layout:

To define layout aspects, like margins, title, axes names, ...
Anything from https://plotly.com/javascript/reference/layout/.

## config:

To define general configurations like enabling scroll to zoom, disabling the modebar, etc.
Anything from https://plotly.com/javascript/configuration-options/.

## hours_to_show:

How many hours are shown.
Exactly the same as the history card, except decimal values (e.g `0.1`) do actually work

## refresh_interval:

Update data every `refresh_interval` seconds. Use `0` or delete the line to disable updates
